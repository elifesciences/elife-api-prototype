        <p>Activated Arf6 directs membrane recruitment of the clathrin adaptor AP-1B to maintain membrane polarization in epithelial cells.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The epithelial cell&#x02013;specific clathrin adaptor complex AP-1B facilitates the sorting of various transmembrane proteins from recycling endosomes (REs) to the basolateral plasma membrane. Despite AP-1B&#x02019;s clear importance in polarized epithelial cells, we still do not fully understand how AP-1B orchestrates basolateral targeting. Here we identify the ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) as an important regulator of AP-1B. We show that activated Arf6 pulled down AP-1B in vitro. Furthermore, interfering with Arf6 function through overexpression of dominant-active Arf6Q67L or dominant-negative Arf6D125N, as well as depletion of Arf6 with short hairpin RNA (shRNA), led to apical missorting of AP-1B&#x02013;dependent cargos. In agreement with these data, we found that Arf6 colocalized with AP-1B and transferrin receptor (TfnR) in REs. In addition, we observed specific recruitment of AP-1B into Arf6-induced membrane ruffles in nonpolarized cells. We conclude that activated
          Arf6 directs membrane recruitment of AP-1B, thus regulating AP-1B&#x02019;s functions in polarized epithelial cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Epithelial cells polarize their plasma membrane into apical and basolateral domains to facilitate vectorial transport of nutrients and waste products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martin-Belmonte and Mostov, 2008</xref>). To maintain this apical-basolateral polarity, epithelial cells sort newly synthesized and recycling transmembrane proteins either in the TGN, recycling endosomes (REs), or both according to their final destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mellman and Nelson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">F&#x000f6;lsch et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Sorting to the basolateral membrane frequently depends on a short peptide motif (Yxx&#x000d8;) encoded in the cytoplasmic tail of the transmembrane protein, which is recognized by heterotetrameric clathrin adaptor protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rodriguez-Boulan et al., 2005</xref>). There are four major classes: AP-1 through AP-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehm and Bonifacino, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brodsky et al., 2001</xref>). Whereas AP-2 localizes to the plasma membrane and facilitates clathrin-mediated endocytosis, AP-1, AP-3, and AP-4 localize to endomembranes and sort cargo in the biosynthetic and/or endocytic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakatsu and Ohno, 2003</xref>). Epithelial cells have two AP-1 complexes&#x02014;AP-1A and AP-1B&#x02014;which share the two large subunits (&#x003b3;- and &#x003b2;1-adaptin) and the small subunit (&#x003c3;1-adaptin), but differ in the incorporation of the medium
        subunits &#x000b5;1A or the epithelial cell&#x02013;specific &#x000b5;1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">F&#x000f6;lsch, 2005</xref>). Although &#x000b5;1A and &#x000b5;1B are 79% identical on the amino acid level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohno et al., 1999</xref>), AP-1A and AP-1B localize to different intracellular compartments and carry out different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">F&#x000f6;lsch et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2003</xref>). AP-1A localizes to the TGN and/or early endosomes and is involved in endosomal/lysosomal targeting. TGN localization of AP-1A is achieved through interaction of AP-1A with the TGN-enriched lipid phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI[4]P) and Arf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirst and Robinson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, AP-1B localizes in REs and facilitates sorting of
        biosynthetic and endocytic cargos to the basolateral plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">F&#x000f6;lsch, 2005</xref>). Biosynthetic cargos that use AP-1B on their way to the surface first move from the TGN into REs in a pathway that is regulated by Rab13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nokes et al., 2008</xref>). Examples of cargos that follow this pathway are the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) and truncated low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR-CT27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fields et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nokes et al., 2008</xref>). Recently, we identified phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI[3,4,5]P<sub>3</sub>) as a signature lipid in REs of AP-1B&#x02013;positive epithelial cells, and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> was necessary for AP-1B recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fields et al., 2010</xref>). However, because polarized
        epithelial cells also exhibit PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> accumulation at the basolateral plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gassama-Diagne et al., 2006</xref>), PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> alone cannot be sufficient for specific membrane recruitment of AP-1B, and other factors must aid in defining AP-1B&#x02019;s intracellular localization.</p>
      <p>Arf6 is the sole member of the class III Arf proteins, and is known for its function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, endocytic recycling, and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donaldson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D&#x02019;Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006</xref>). To fulfill its different tasks, Arf6 interacts with a variety of effector proteins. For example, Arf6 interacts with and stimulates phospholipase D (PLD), an enzyme that cleaves phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vitale et al., 2005</xref>). Activation of PLD by Arf6 is necessary for recycling of endocytic cargo in &#x000b5;1B-negative HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jovanovic et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, Arf6 regulates the actin cytoskeleton, perhaps through interactions with its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) EFA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luton et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, Arf6
        interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase I&#x003b3;-90 (PIPKI&#x003b3;-90), which is important for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI[4,5]P<sub>2</sub>) production during AP-2&#x02013;dependent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krauss et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, PIPKI&#x003b3;-90 also interacts with AP-1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2007</xref>) and has been suggested to play a role in PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> formation in REs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fields et al., 2010</xref>). In epithelial cells, it has further been suggested that Arf6 operates in REs, where it may directly interact with and recruit the Sec10 subunit of the exocyst complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prigent et al., 2003</xref>) independently or in cooperation with AP-1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">F&#x000f6;lsch et al., 2003</xref>). The exocyst complex is believed to tether AP-1B vesicles to the sites of fusion at the
        basolateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">F&#x000f6;lsch, 2005</xref>). It should be noted, however, that direct evidence of Arf6 localization in REs is missing so far. In contrast, early studies with &#x000b5;1B-negative CHO cell lysates suggested that Arf6 might exclusively localize to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavenagh et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this study, we define a novel role for Arf6 in basolateral exocytosis from REs via regulation of the AP-1B pathway.</p>

        <title>Arf6 interacts with AP-1B in vitro</title>
        <p>First we tested whether AP-1B might interact with the two major Arf proteins present in cells: Arf1 and Arf6. Although the function of Arf1 in coat recruitment is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D&#x02019;Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006</xref>), the involvement of Arf6 in direct coat recruitment is less clear. However, there have been some studies indicating that Arf6 may directly interact with adaptor proteins. Arf6 could be cross-linked to AP-1A and AP-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Austin et al., 2002</xref>), and activated Arf6 could precipitate AP-1A from brain lysate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krauss et al., 2003</xref>). To test whether Arf1 or Arf6 may interact with AP-1B, we created fusion proteins of GST and various Arfs. We first tested the dominant-active mutants Arf1Q71L and Arf6Q67L as well as the dominant-negative mutants Arf1T31N and Arf6T27N. Arf1Q71L and Arf6Q67L can no longer hydrolyze GTP and are thus locked in the GTP
          forms, whereas Arf1T31N and Arf6T27N are locked in the GDP forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donaldson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nie and Randazzo, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, in this assay, we used Arf1 proteins with deleted N termini, &#x00394;17Arf1Q71L and &#x00394;17Arf1T31N, to ensure functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Paris et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
        <p>GST fusion proteins were purified from <italic>Escherichia</italic>
          <italic>coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Subsequently, purified proteins were bound to glutathione beads and incubated with cell lysate of EFA47 cells as a probe for AP-1B or lysate of 3T3 fibroblasts as a probe for AP-1A as a positive control. EFA47 cells are mouse embryonic fibroblasts that are knocked out for &#x000b5;1A/AP-1A, but express &#x000b5;1B/AP-1B exogenously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">F&#x000f6;lsch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eskelinen et al., 2002</xref>). We found that both active mutant proteins, Arf6Q67L and Arf1Q71L, pulled down AP-1B and AP-1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), whereas the inactive Arf6T27N and Arf1T31N mutant proteins did not pull down either adaptor complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In a direct comparison, activated Arf6 and activated Arf1 pulled down comparable amounts of AP-1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>).
          Furthermore, AP-1B was also precipitated by an Arf6 effector domain mutant, Arf6Q67L/Q37E/S38I, but not by the inactive mutant protein Arf6D125N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Arf6Q67L leads to apical missorting of VSVG</title>
        <p>To test the idea that Arf1 or Arf6 may play a role in basolateral sorting, we used a microinjection-based assay in which cDNAs encoding V5-tagged Arf mutant proteins were injected into polarized, filter-grown MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2011</xref>). As shown previously, this assay of acute overexpression typically prevents the onset of secondary effects often observed with long-term overexpression of mutant GTPases by transient transfections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nokes et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
        <p>First we analyzed VSVG sorting in the presence of overexpressed Arf6 mutant proteins. We coinjected cDNAs encoding Arf6T27N or Arf6Q67L together with plasmids encoding the temperature-sensitive, GFP-tagged VSVGts045. The VSVGts045-GFP variant used here has an added spacer (SP) between the cytoplasmic tail and the GFP moiety to allow for efficient basolateral sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keller et al., 2001</xref>). Using VSVGts045 has the added benefit that surface delivery can be arrested in the ER at the nonpermissive temperature of 39&#x000b0;C while the mutant Arf6 proteins are synthesized in the cytosol. After 2 h of incubation at 39&#x000b0;C, cells were shifted to the permissive temperature of 31&#x000b0;C for 2 h in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) to prevent further protein synthesis. At 31&#x000b0;C, VSVGts045-GFP folds correctly and is delivered to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scales et al., 1997</xref>). During surface
          delivery, VSVG moves from the TGN into REs to be sorted along the AP-1B pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">F&#x000f6;lsch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ang et al., 2004</xref>). VSVG at the surface was stained with an antibody recognizing its ectodomain before fixation and staining for V5-tagged Arf6. Specimens were analyzed by confocal microscopy and quantified using Volocity software to determine the percentage of total VSVG pixels at the basolateral membrane, as described in Materials and methods. We found that in both mock-injected cells and cells coexpressing Arf6T27N, VSVG was efficiently delivered to the basolateral membrane (92% and 93%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In contrast, we found only 42% of the total VSVG at the basolateral membrane in cells coexpressing Arf6Q67L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, P &#x0003c; 0.0001, see figure legend). Importantly, Arf6Q67L did not disrupt
          polarity in general, as judged by the lateral staining of the marker protein gp58, the tight junction localization of ZO-1, and the presence of the primary cilium under the same experimental conditions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201106010/DC1">Fig. S1, A and B</ext-link>, middle panels).</p>

Cells were then incubated for 2 h at 39&#x000b0;C followed by 2 h at 31&#x000b0;C in the presence of CHX. Subsequently, cells were stained for V5-tagged Arf proteins, total VSVG (anti-GFP antibodies), and surface VSVG (A and B), or Arf1T31N-V5 and endogenous GM130 (C). Specimens were analyzed by confocal microscopy and representative xz sections are shown. Arrows in C denote microinjected cells. Data in A and B represent mean values and SD of pixel distributions determined from at least three independent experiments as described in Materials and methods.

        </fig>
        <p>We then tested Arf1T31N and Arf1Q71L in the same assay. Unlike Arf6Q67L, overexpression of Arf1Q71L had no effect on basolateral delivery of VSVG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Because both Arf1Q71L and Arf6Q67L are able to pull down AP-1B to the same extent in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), these results argue that Arf6Q67L may not simply titer out AP-1B in the cytosol but may inhibit basolateral sorting through a more specific mechanism. Furthermore, we observed a complete inhibition of surface delivery in the presence of Arf1T31N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This is most likely caused by a loss of functional Golgi, as indicated by a lack of GM130 staining in virtually every microinjected cell analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). A similar effect is seen after adding the fungal metabolite brefeldin A to eukaryotic cells, which inhibits the Golgi-localized Arf1 GEFs BIG1, BIG2, and
          GBF1 and results in a secretion block from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klausner et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Citterio et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
        <p>To summarize, direct comparison of Arf1 and Arf6 mutant proteins in a microinjection-based sorting assay suggests that Arf6 but not Arf1 may have a regulatory function in the AP-1B pathway.</p>

        <title>Arf6 partially colocalizes with AP-1B in REs</title>
        <p>Because Arf proteins typically localize to donor membranes to facilitate vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D&#x02019;Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006</xref>), we sought to localize Arf6 in epithelial cells. To this end we used LLC-PK1 cell lines stably expressing &#x000b5;1A or &#x000b5;1B with internal HA tags (LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1A-HA or LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1B-HA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">F&#x000f6;lsch et al., 2003</xref>). Because of the lack of an antibody suitable for Arf6 detection by immunofluorescence, we transiently expressed low levels of V5-tagged wild-type Arf6 in cells grown in large clusters on coverslips and costained for Arf6 and AP-1A or AP-1B. Specimens were analyzed by confocal microscopy. We then determined the percentage overlap between Arf6 and AP-1A or AP-1B at the TGN or in REs, respectively, using Volocity software as described in Materials and methods. We found only a small percentage (23%) of exogenously expressed Arf6
          colocalizing with AP-1A at the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A, A&#x02032;, and D</xref>). In contrast, Arf6 showed a significantly (P &#x0003c; 0.001) higher degree of colocalization with AP-1B in REs (44%) in addition to its localization at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A, A&#x02032;, and D</xref>).</p>

        <p>To confirm the recycling endosomal localization of Arf6, we then analyzed Arf6 staining relative to that of transferrin receptor (TfnR). Perinuclear TfnR staining is commonly used as a marker for REs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sheff et al., 1999</xref>). We found partial colocalization between Arf6 and TfnR in both LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1A-HA (44%) and LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1B-HA (40%) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B, B&#x02032;, and D</xref>). To analyze whether the observed localization of Arf6 in REs is also present in polarized cells, we grew LLC-PK1 cells stably transfected with &#x000b5;1B (LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1B) on filter supports, transiently transfected polarized cells with plasmids encoding V5-tagged Arf6, and analyzed Arf6 localization with respect to TfnR. We found Arf6 and TfnR colocalizing in REs of polarized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and C&#x02032;</xref>).</p>
        <p>Thus, in epithelial cells, Arf6 localizes to the plasma membrane and localizes partially in REs together with AP-1B and TfnR.</p>

        <title>VSVG sorting in the presence of various Arf6 mutant proteins</title>
        <p>To learn more about the function of Arf6 in AP-1B&#x02013;dependent sorting, we created various Arf6 mutant alleles as described in the literature and analyzed their effects on VSVGts045-GFP sorting using overexpression of V5-tagged Arf6 mutant proteins by microinjection as an assay.</p>
        <p>First, we introduced an effector domain mutation into Arf6 to create Arf6N48I. This mutant still binds to PLD, but is deficient in PLD activation and inhibits Arf6 signaling through PLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vitale et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jovanovic et al., 2006</xref>). Because we introduced the N48I mutation into wild-type Arf6, we first tested the fidelity of VSVG sorting in the presence of overexpressed Arf6. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>, VSVG was still largely basolateral (87%) in the presence of Arf6. The same was true for VSVG sorting in the presence of Arf6N48I (86% basolateral). Thus it seems that activation of PLD through Arf6 may not be a necessary function in basolateral sorting.</p>

Cells were processed as described for VSVG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Specimens were analyzed by confocal microscopy, and representative xz sections are shown. Numerical data were obtained by using Volocity software, as described in Materials and methods, from at least three independent experiments.

        <p>Next we mutated two residues adjacent to the switch I domain&#x02014;Q37 and S38&#x02014;in Arf6Q67L to create the effector domain mutant Arf6Q67L/Q37E/S38I. This mutant is defective in remodeling the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Awar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Palacios et al., 2001</xref>) without inhibiting Arf6-mediated membrane trafficking steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Awar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Palacios et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, Arf6Q67L/Q37E/S38I precipitated AP-1B as well as Arf6Q67L in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Because previous studies had shown that the additional Q37E/S38I mutations rescued Arf6Q67L phenotypes that were related to Arf6&#x02019;s function in remodeling the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Palacios et al., 2001</xref>), we asked whether VSVG missorting was affected by these
          additional mutations. We observed a slight, albeit significant increase (P &#x0003c; 0.0001) in basolaterally localized VSVG (57%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>) when Arf6Q67L/Q37E/S38I was expressed in comparison to Arf6Q67L (42%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Because VSVG was still sorted randomly (P vs. mock control &#x0003c; 0.0001) it seems that actin remodeling by Arf6 may not be its primary role in basolateral targeting.</p>
        <p>We then sought to test another dominant-negative allele, Arf6D125N. This protein is a nucleotide switch mutant that can no longer bind guanine nucleotides, but uses xanthine nucleotides instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang and Mueckler, 1999</xref>). Thus Arf6D125N is presumed to be in an inactive, nucleotide-free form in cells. Indeed, in a GST pull-down assay, this mutant failed to precipitate AP-1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, lane 2). We found that Arf6D125N overexpression randomized VSVG localization with only &#x0223c;50% of the total VSVG at the basolateral membrane in cells coexpressing Arf6D125N and VSVG (P &#x0003c; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). This missorting was not caused by a general loss of cell polarity. As shown in Fig. S1 (A and B, right panels), the basolateral localization of gp58, the tight junction localization of ZO-1, and the presence of the primary cilium were unchanged when Arf6D125N was
          overexpressed after microinjection of its cDNA.</p>
        <p>Arf6 largely resides on membranes in its GDP- and GTP-bound forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">D&#x02019;Souza-Schorey et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, we sought to test whether the dominant-negative effects of Arf6D125N and Arf6Q67L were dependent on membrane localization. We introduced G2A mutations in the myristoylation motif that had been shown to result in nonmyristoylated Arf6 with a cytosolic distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knorr et al., 2000</xref>). We found that a secondary G2A mutation in Arf6D125N, Arf6D125N/G2A, resulted in a statistically significant reduction of basolaterally localized VSVG from 47% down to 35% (P &#x0003c; 0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). These data indicate that Arf6D125N may be a more potent inhibitor when localized in the cytosol, perhaps because of increased interactions with its GEFs. In contrast, nonmyristoylated Arf6Q67L, Arf6Q67L/G2A, was significantly less potent (P &#x0003c; 0.002) as an
          inhibitor of VSVG sorting (61% basolateral, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>) than the single Arf6Q67L mutant protein (42% basolateral, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). We conclude that Arf6Q67L is most active in interfering with basolateral sorting when the protein is membrane localized.</p>
        <p>As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>, of all Arf6 mutant proteins tested we found two single mutants that led to apical missorting of VSVG: the dominant-active Arf6Q67L and the dominant-negative Arf6D125N. Furthermore, through the use of effector domain mutant proteins, we conclude that Arf6&#x02019;s primary role in basolateral sorting may not be to activate PLD or to rearrange the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, we will focus on Arf6Q67L and Arf6D125N for the remainder of the manuscript.</p>

        <title>Arf6D125N or Arf6Q67L expression influences PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels in REs</title>
        <p>Previously we showed that recruitment of AP-1B to REs depended on PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fields et al., 2010</xref>). Its production may involve PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> as an intermediate and activation of PIPKI&#x003b3;-90 via AP-1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fields et al., 2010</xref>). Because active Arf6 interacts with and stimulates the kinase activity of PIPKI&#x003b3;-90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krauss et al., 2003</xref>), we asked whether expression of Arf6D125N or Arf6Q67L may alter PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> accumulation in REs. Thus, we cotransfected MDCK cells with plasmids encoding the GFP-tagged pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt, PH-Akt-GFP, as a sensor for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fields et al., 2010</xref>), and either V5-tagged Arf6D125N or V5-tagged Arf6Q67L. Data analysis revealed &#x0223c;60% overlap between TfnR and PH-Akt-GFP in REs of control
          cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201106010/DC1">Fig. S2, A, A&#x02032;, and B</ext-link>). In contrast, overexpression of Arf6D125N or Arf6Q67L reduced the overlap between TfnR and PH-Akt-GFP in REs to &#x0223c;35% (P &#x0003c; 0.0001) or &#x0223c;45% (P &#x0003c; 0.01), respectively (Fig. S2, A, A&#x02032;, and B). Furthermore, although we found &#x0223c;65% of the total PH-Akt-GFP signal at the plasma membrane in control cells, this value dropped to &#x0223c;50% (P &#x0003c; 0.01) in cells coexpressing Arf6D125N and &#x0223c;30% (P &#x0003c; 0.0001) in cells coexpressing Arf6Q67L (Fig. S2 C).</p>
        <p>Collectively, we found a small yet significant reduction in PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> accumulation in REs when Arf6D125N or Arf6Q67L were overexpressed in MDCK cells. However, because PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels did not change dramatically, this effect may not be a major reason for VSVG missorting in the presence of Arf6D125N or Arf6Q67L.</p>

        <title>Arf6D125N fails to colocalize with AP-1B</title>
        <p>Next we studied the localization of Arf6D125N in LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1A-HA and LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1B-HA cell lines. We transiently expressed low levels of V5-tagged Arf6D125N and costained for Arf6D125N and AP-1A-HA or AP-1B-HA. We found Arf6D125N localizing to the plasma membrane and also in a perinuclear region. Although the percent overlap between Arf6D125N and AP-1A was roughly the same (32%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A, A&#x02032;, and D</xref>) as the one between Arf6 and AP-1A (23%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>), we observed a statistically significant change in colocalization with regards to AP-1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A, A&#x02032;, and D</xref>). Unlike wild-type Arf6 (45%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>), Arf6D125N failed to partially colocalize with AP-1B, and the overlap was reduced to 19% (P &#x0003c; 0.0001). Importantly, Arf6D125N still partially colocalized with TfnR in REs (45% in

        <title>Arf6D125N overexpression leads to selective missorting of AP-1B&#x02013;dependent cargos</title>
        <p>So far we found that Arf6D125N and Arf6Q67L overexpression led to apical missorting of VSVG. To test whether this effect was specific for the AP-1B pathway, we expressed additional, well-established cargos for basolateral or apical sorting using similar microinjection protocols (see the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). First we analyzed LDLR-CT27, which like VSVG moves from the TGN into REs during biosynthetic delivery (i.e., during the chase period of our protocol) to be sorted to the basolateral membrane by AP-1B in cooperation with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia protein (ARH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fields et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang and F&#x000f6;lsch, 2011</xref>). We found that on average 82% of LDLR-CT27 was delivered to the basolateral membrane in mock-injected cells. In contrast, LDLR-CT27 was missorted to the apical membrane in cells coexpressing Arf6D125N or Arf6Q67L (<xref
            ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). In both cases, only 45% (P &#x0003c; 0.0001) of the total surface signal was left at the basolateral membrane.</p>

(A and B) After microinjection, cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h followed by 4 h at 20&#x000b0;C and 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C in the presence of CHX. Cells were stained for Arf6-V5 proteins and surface LDLR. For numerical data of LDLR-CT27 sorting, we analyzed 23 mock-injected cells, 24 cells coexpressing Arf6D125N, and 29 cells coexpressing Arf6Q67L from four independent experiments.

              basolateral and apical pixels, as was done in all other cases. P &#x0003c; 0.0001 for both mutant proteins versus mock control.

        </fig>
        <p>We then analyzed a point mutant of LDLR, LDLR(Y18A). This cargo is thought to move from the TGN to the basolateral membrane without traversing REs during biosynthetic delivery, and basolateral localization is independent of AP-1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fields et al., 2007</xref>). In mock-injected cells as well as in cells coexpressing Arf6D125N, we found LDLR(Y18A) delivered exclusively to the basolateral membrane (99% and 96%, respectively). In contrast, we observed a slight reduction in the fidelity of basolateral delivery when Arf6Q67L was coexpressed (83% basolateral). However, the majority of LDLR(Y18A) was still sorted correctly, which suggests that Arf6 does not play a primary role in LDLR(Y18A) sorting.</p>
        <p>As an apical cargo that traverses the REs during biosynthetic delivery, we analyzed the apical variant of VSVGts045-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ang et al., 2004</xref>). A-VSVGts045-GFP is sorted to the apical membrane because of a closer spacing of the GFP moiety to its cytoplasmic tail (i.e., no SP spacer as in the basolaterally sorted VSVGts045-GFP), which seems to obstruct the basolateral sorting signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keller et al., 2001</xref>). Quantification of total A-VSVG at the surface revealed that 94% of A-VSVG was sorted to the apical membrane in mock-injected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). In cells coexpressing Arf6D125N, we found that 80% (P &#x0003c; 0.0001) of the total A-VSVG was still sorted to the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). In contrast, in cells coexpressing Arf6Q67L, A-VSVG sorting to the plasma membrane was randomized with only 46% (P &#x0003c; 0.0001) of the
          total signal found at the apical membrane. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). Perhaps Arf6Q67L overexpression unmasked the basolateral sorting signal of A-VSVG to some extent perhaps by compromising the sorting fidelity of REs. Regardless, this finding corroborates an important function for Arf6 in REs. Importantly, because Arf6D125N did not lead to basolateral sorting of A-VSVG, we surmise that Arf6 does not normally play a role in A-VSVG sorting.</p>
        <p>Finally, we analyzed a cargo, influenza HA, that moves from the TGN into apical early endosomes during apical delivery without passage through REs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cresawn et al., 2007</xref>). Quantification of HA at the surface revealed that 99% of HA was found apically in mock-injected cells. Furthermore, 96% was found apically in cells coexpressing either Arf6D125N or Arf6Q67L.</p>
        <p>In summary, Arf6D125N and Arf6Q67L both inhibited basolateral sorting of AP-1B&#x02013;dependent cargos VSVG and LDLR-CT27. In addition, Arf6Q67L, but not Arf6D125N, randomized apical delivery of A-VSVG. Importantly, neither Arf6D125N nor Arf6Q67L had any effect on apical delivery of HA.</p>

        <title>Knockdown of Arf6 leads to apical missorting of LDLR-CT27</title>
        <p>To confirm a role for Arf6 in basolateral sorting, we stably depleted Arf6 in LLC-PK1 cell lines. To this end, we used lentiviruses encoding GFP-tagged short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting a conserved region of Arf6 transcripts. Lentiviruses targeting glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as negative controls. Quantitative Western blot analysis revealed that Arf6 levels were reduced by &#x0223c;90% in cells stably depleted of Arf6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>).</p>

Although &#x0223c;80% of LDLR-CT27 was localized at the basolateral membrane at steady-state in control cells depleted of GAPDH, we found only &#x0223c;55% of this receptor at the basolateral membrane in cells depleted of Arf6 (P &#x0003c; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>).

        <p>To learn more about the molecular mechanisms that led to apical missorting when Arf6 function was impaired, we investigated AP-1B membrane recruitment either by immunofluorescence or through isolation of clathrin-coated vesicles from LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1B-HA cells stably depleted of Arf6 or GAPDH. We did not observe clear effects (unpublished data), perhaps because other Arf proteins might step in for Arf6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2005</xref>), without restoring full functionality as judged by LDLR-CT27 missorting.

        <title>Arf6 recruits AP-1B to plasma membrane protrusions</title>
        <p>Finally, we sought an experimental setting that would unambiguously show how Arf6 influences AP-1B localization. Arf6 had been shown to induce lamellipodia when activated in MDCK cells at the edges of cell clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Santy and Casanova, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donaldson, 2003</xref>). Because these protrusions contain activated Arf6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Santy and Casanova, 2001</xref>), we wondered whether lamellipodia formation would alter AP-1B distribution. Therefore, we transfected LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1B-HA cells grown in small clusters on coverslips with plasmids encoding V5-tagged wild-type Arf6. Transfection of LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1A-HA cells was used as a negative control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>, LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1B-HA as well as LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1A-HA cells growing at the edge of clusters readily formed lamellipodia in response to Arf6 overexpression. Furthermore,
          in LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1B-HA cells, we observed a strong colocalization between Arf6 and AP-1B in cell protrusions in virtually every cell analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, A and A&#x02032;</xref>). In contrast, only little, if any, AP-1A was recruited to Arf6-induced membrane protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, B and B&#x02032;</xref>). Regardless of whether or not AP-1B has a physiological function in membrane ruffles, these data imply that indeed Arf6 specifically recruits AP-1B onto membranes.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>To gain a mechanistic understanding of AP-1B&#x02013;mediated sorting, it is essential to unravel how AP-1B is recruited onto REs to initiate cargo selection and formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. With Arf6, we have identified a key regulator of AP-1B: Arf6 pulled down AP-1B in vitro and colocalized with AP-1B in TfnR-positive REs. In addition, Arf6 function was needed for proper basolateral targeting of AP-1B&#x02013;dependent cargos. Furthermore, unlike other regulators that influence intracellular localization of AP-1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fields et al., 2007</xref>), Arf6 is the only one found so far that is capable of redirecting AP-1B to a complete different location, i.e., to membrane ruffles forming at plasma membranes. Thus it seems reasonable to assume that Arf6 has a constitutive function in recruiting AP-1B onto REs. In agreement with such a key role of Arf6 are recent findings
        demonstrating that Arf6 is highly expressed in polarized epithelial cells of mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>We found that Arf6 depletion led to apical missorting of LDLR-CT27; however, we did not detect clear effects on AP-1B localization when Arf6 expression was reduced. Perhaps depletion of Arf6 creates a void that may be filled by other Arfs without restoring correct interplay and timing of protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Indeed, it has been noted previously that Arf functions are somewhat redundant and that Arf proteins had to be depleted in pairs to inhibit membrane trafficking through the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2005</xref>). Alternatively, it might be possible that two Arf proteins work in tandem to ensure proper AP-1B function, as GEFs of the ARNO/cytohesin/Grp1 family had been shown to bind to two Arfs simultaneously, thus functioning as an effector of one and activator of another Arf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DiNitto et al., 2007</xref>).
        Regardless, our data indicate a specific need for Arf6.</p>
      <p>We identified two Arf6 mutant proteins that are dominant negative for AP-1B function: Arf6D125N and Arf6Q67L. Previously, Arf6 had been known to play a role in endocytosis from the apical membrane in polarized epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altschuler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hyman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolff et al., 2008</xref>). However, initial basolateral targeting of newly synthesized proteins is upstream of postendocytic recycling. Thus, a block in endocytosis would not explain the sorting defects we observed. Furthermore, Arf6 had been found to regulate tight junction integrity mainly via its GEF EFA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klein et al., 2008</xref>). However, under conditions where VSVG and LDLR-CT27 were delivered to the apical membrane, the tight junctions remained intact (Fig. S1), ruling out the possibility that
        disrupted tight junctions led to missorting in our assay. Still, the dominant-negative Arf6 mutant protein, Arf6T27N, had been shown to localize to adherens junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Palacios et al., 2001</xref>), which might explain why we did not observe missorting of VSVG in the presence of Arf6T27N. It simply might not be very effective in sequestering Arf6 GEFs in REs.</p>
      <p>It is further unlikely that Arf6Q67L inhibits basolateral sorting by just sequestering AP-1B. If that were the case, we would have expected a similar inhibition of basolateral sorting upon overexpression of Arf1Q71L because both active mutant proteins pull down comparable amounts of AP-1B in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Perhaps in vivo, productive interaction between adaptor complexes and Arf GTPases requires membrane localization. Indeed, the cytosolic form of Arf6Q67L&#x02014;Arf6Q67L/G2A&#x02014;was a less potent inhibitor of VSVG sorting than membrane-bound Arf6Q67L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Unfortunately, transient expression of Arf6Q67L in LLC-PK1 cells was toxic; therefore, we could not analyze whether AP-1B and Arf6Q67L may colocalize. Regardless, in the future it will be interesting to learn how heterotetrameric adaptor complexes such as AP-1B interact with active, membrane-localized Arf proteins.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Arf6D125N failed to colocalize with AP-1B, though it still colocalized with TfnR in REs. These data indicate that perhaps active Arf6 is needed for linking AP-1B recruitment onto REs with productive cargo selection. Arf6D125N may inhibit the activation of endogenous Arf6 by sequestering its GEFs in REs. Intriguingly, AP-1B is not totally displaced from its perinuclear localization in the presence of Arf6D125N. Previously, we showed that PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> was necessary for AP-1B recruitment onto REs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fields et al., 2010</xref>). Perhaps PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is responsible for residual AP-1B localization in REs when Arf6D125N is expressed, without being able to sustain basolateral sorting of AP-1B cargos. Indeed, our data indicate that overexpression of Arf6D125N (or Arf6Q67L) has only moderate effects on PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels in REs. These data also indirectly argue that Arf6 may not regulate AP-1B function via
        activation of PIPKI&#x003b3;-90 and influencing PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels. In fact, not only Arf6 but also AP-1B itself is able to bind and activate PIPKI&#x003b3;-90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krauss et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2007</xref>), and AP-1B expression is necessary for PIPKI&#x003b3;-90 localization in REs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fields et al., 2010</xref>). This indicates that perhaps spatial and temporal activation of PIPKI&#x003b3;-90 may be regulated by both Arf6 and AP-1B.</p>
      <p>Previously, Arf6 was mainly found localizing at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavenagh et al., 1996</xref>), which is in agreement with its functions in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D&#x02019;Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006</xref>). However, there were also findings of endosomal Arf6 localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marshansky et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 1998</xref>). Here we show that in AP-1B&#x02013;positive epithelial cells, Arf6 localizes to TfnR-positive REs. This dual localization and function of proteins at the plasma membrane and in REs has already been described for other factors such as PIPKI&#x003b3;-90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fields et al., 2010</xref>) and ARH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang and F&#x000f6;lsch, 2011</xref>). This implies similarities between REs and the plasma membrane
        with regard to biochemical identity. Indeed, PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> accumulates at the leading edge of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Franca-Koh et al., 2007</xref>), the basolateral plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gassama-Diagne et al., 2006</xref>), and in REs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fields et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it may not be entirely surprising that we found AP-1B localizing to the plasma membrane in response to Arf6 activation, and it will be interesting to learn whether AP-1B has a function at the plasma membrane under these conditions.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, data presented in this study strongly imply a regulatory function for Arf6 in AP-1B&#x02013;mediated protein sorting, most likely through recruitment of AP-1B onto PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-positive REs.</p>

        <p>HA-tagged versions of wild-type Arf6, Arf6T27N, and Arf6Q67L were received from P. Chavrier (Institut Curie, Paris, France). These cDNAs were subsequently used as PCR templates using Arf6-a and Arf6-b as primers, thereby introducing a C-terminal V5-tag (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201106010/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>). PCR products were cloned as KpnI&#x02013;XbaI fragments into pShuttle-CMV. V5-tagged Arf6 wild type and mutants were then amplified using primers Arf6-c and Arf6-d (Table S1) to generate PCR products with EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites for cloning into the microinjection vector pRKV. To generate GST fusion proteins, V5-tagged Arf6 wild type and mutants were amplified using primers Arf6-e and Arf6-f (Table S1), which introduced BglII and XhoI restriction sites for cloning of V5-tagged Arf6 in frame behind GST into pGEX-6P-1.</p>
        <p>For site-directed mutagenesis of Arf6, we performed QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies) using V5-tagged Arf6 in pShuttle as a template with corresponding sense and anti-sense primers. The sense primer for the generation of Arf6D125N was Arf6-D125N (Table S1), and the sense primer for Arf6N48I generation was Arf6-N48I (Table S1). To generate Arf6Q67L/Q37E/S38I, we used V5-tagged Arf6Q67L as template, and the sense primer was Arf6-QS (Table S1). To generate G2A mutations, we used V5-tagged Arf6Q67L or V5-tagged Arf6D125N in pShuttle as templates, and the Arf6-G2A as N-terminal and Arf6-d as C-terminal primer for cloning of Arf6Q67L/G2A or Arf6D125N/G2A into pRKV.</p>
        <p>To clone GST fusions of Arf1 in which the N-terminal 17 amino acids had been deleted (&#x00394;17Arf1), we used His-tagged fusion constructs of wild-type Arf1 or Arf1Q71L provided to us by G. Warren (Max F. Perutz Laboratories, Vienna, Austria) and J. Donaldson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) as templates and Arf1-a and Arf1-b primers (Table S1) to generate PCR products with BamHI and XhoI restriction sites for cloning into pGEX-6P-1. Arf1T31N was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using Arf1-T31N as the sense primer and wild-type Arf1 as a template. V5-tagged Arf1T31N and V5-tagged Arf1Q71L were first cloned into pShuttle-CMV as PCR fragments using Arf1-c and Arf1-d (Table S1) as primers, thereby introducing C-terminal V5 tags. Arf1T31N-V5 and Arf1Q71L-V5 were subsequently subcloned as BglII&#x02013;XbaI fragments from pShuttle into pRKV.</p>
        <p>Plasmids encoding VSVGts045-GFP, A-VSVG-GFP, LDLR-CT27, LDLR(Y18A), or HA have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nokes et al., 2008</xref>). Plasmids encoding PH-Akt-GFP were a gift from P. Devreotes (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). Defective adenoviruses encoding LDLR-CT27 or LDLR(Y18A) have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fields et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
        <p>The shRNAmir construct in the lentiviral vector pGIPz targeting human, mouse, and rat (and porcine) Arf6 (oligo ID V2LMM_67737, sequence was: 5&#x02032;-TGCTGTTGAC&#x000ad;AGTGAGCGAGC&#x000ad;TCACATGGTTA&#x000ad;ACCTCTAATAG&#x000ad;TGAAGCCACAG&#x000ad;ATGTATTAGAG&#x000ad;GTTAACCATGT&#x000ad;GAGCCTGCCTA&#x000ad;CTGCCTCGGA-3&#x02032;) was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The construct targeting human GAPDH was as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nokes et al., 2008</xref>). Replication-defective lentiviruses were produced by cotransfecting pGIPz, pMD2G, and psPAX2 into HEK293T cells using a standard method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salmon and Trono, 2006</xref>).</p>

        <title>Antibodies</title>
        <p>Mouse monoclonal antibodies were as follows: anti-HA (16B12) from BabCo, anti&#x02013;&#x003b3;-adaptin (88) and anti-GM130 (610822) from BD, anti-acetylated tubulin (6-11B-1) from Sigma-Aldrich, anti-ZO-1 from Invitrogen, and anti-actin (C4) from Millipore. Anti-V5 antibodies were generated by R. Randall (University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland, UK) and obtained from R. Lamb (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing GFP (ab90) were from Abcam, antibodies recognizing GST (A-5800) were from Invitrogen, and anti-Arf6 antibodies were a gift from J. Donaldson (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Goat polyclonal antibodies directed against the ectodomain of HA (anti-H3 [A/HongKong/1/68], NR-3118) were obtained through the National Institutes of Health Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases). Hybridoma cell lines producing antibodies directed against LDLR (C7),
          TfnR (H68.4), gp58, or VSVG (TK1) have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fields et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
        <p>Secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor fluorophores were purchased from Invitrogen, Cy5-labeled secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories or SouthernBiotech, and HRP-conjugated antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories.</p>

        <title>Cell culture and immunofluorescence analysis</title>
        <p>All cells were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and media were supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine unless stated otherwise. MDCK cells were maintained in MEM (7% fetal bovine serum). 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in DME (10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine), and EFA47 cells were maintained in DME (10% fetal bovine serum) and 200 &#x000b5;g/ml hygromycin. HEK293T cells were grown in DME (10% fetal bovine serum) on plates coated with fibronectin and collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nokes et al., 2008</xref>). LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1A-HA, LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1B-HA, and LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1B cells were grown in &#x003b1;-MEM (7% fetal bovine serum) containing 1 mg/ml geneticin. Finally, HEK293 cells for amplification of defective adenoviruses were grown in DME (10% fetal bovine serum).</p>
        <p>LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1B cells depleted of Arf6 or GAPDH were generated by infecting the cells with lentiviruses encoding shRNAs targeting Arf6 or GAPDH, respectively. 24&#x02013;48 h after infection, growth media were supplemented with 16 &#x000b5;g/ml puromycin to select and subsequently maintain infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2005</xref>). Cells were used for experiments as soon as possible after selection with puromycin.</p>
        <p>For experiments with polarized cells, MDCK or LLC-PK1::&#x000b5;1B cells were seeded at a density of 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells per 12-mm filter (0.4 &#x000b5;g pore size; Corning) and cultured for 3&#x02013;4 d with changes of medium in the basolateral chambers every day. For microinjection experiments, cells were seeded onto clear filters. For immunofluorescence experiments with cells grown on coverslips, cells were seeded onto Alcian Blue&#x02013;coated coverslips and grown for 3&#x02013;4 d. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p>
        <p>Infections of filter-grown LLC-PK1 cells depleted of Arf6 or GAPDH with defective adenoviruses were performed 3 d after seeding in serum-free media with the viruses added to the apical chamber and gentle rocking at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 h. Media were then exchanged with regular growth media. After &#x0223c;24 h, cells were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described below.</p>
        <p>Microinjection of cells was performed exactly as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nokes et al., 2008</xref>), using a Femtojet microinjector (Injectman NI2; Eppendorf) mounted on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200, Carl Zeiss) with a heated stage. In brief, cells grown on filter supports were placed in Hepes-buffered media (50 mM Hepes) and microinjected with 0.2 mg/ml cDNAs at 39&#x000b0;C (VSVG) or 37&#x000b0;C (LDLR mutant proteins and HA). After injection, cells were typically further incubated at the microinjection temperature or 20&#x000b0;C, followed by a chase at 31&#x000b0;C (VSVG) or 37&#x000b0;C (non-VSVG cargos) for 1&#x02013;2 h in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml CHX (see figure legends for details on incubation times).</p>
        <p>Cell surface staining, fixation of the cells in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and staining of fixed cells was performed essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nokes et al., 2008</xref>). In brief, for surface staining, cells were directly incubated with primary antibodies directed against the ectodomain of transmembrane receptors on ice for 1 h before fixation and permeabilization of the cells. To permeabilize cells after fixation, probes were incubated for 1 h in a blocking/permeabilization buffer (BPB; 2% [wt/vol] BSA, 0.4% [wt/vol] saponin in PBS<sup>2+</sup> [PBS {0.2 g/liter KCl, 0.2 g/liter KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 8 g/liter NaCl, and 2.17 g/liter Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> &#x000d7; 7 H<sub>2</sub>O} plus 0.1 g/liter CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.1 g/liter MgCl<sub>2</sub> &#x000d7; 6 H<sub>2</sub>O]) with 10% [vol/vol] goat serum. After permeabilization, cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in BPB
          for 1 h, washed, and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in BPB for 1 h. Cells were mounted in a water solution containing 10% [wt/vol] DABCO and 50% [wt/vol] glycerol.</p>
        <p>Specimens were analyzed at room temperature using a confocal microscope (Microsystem LSM 510 with ConfoCor3 software; Carl Zeiss) equipped with a C-Apochromat 63&#x000d7; 1.2 NA water immersion objective lens or a confocal microscope (LSM 510; Zen software) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63&#x000d7; 1.4 oil immersion objective lens for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref> (all from Carl Zeiss).

        <title>GST pull-down assays</title>
        <p>GST fusion proteins were produced in and purified out of <italic>E. coli</italic> using GSTrap columns from GE Healthcare according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations and desalted subsequently. The concentrations of purified proteins were determined using the BCA assay from Thermo Fisher Scientific and adjusted with respect to Western blot signals in comparison to GST.</p>
        <p>For pull-downs, 0.5 mg GST or GST fusion protein were bound to glutathione Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) in the presence of 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM nucleotide (GDP for Arf1T31N, Arf6T27N, and Arf6D125N; GTP for Arf1Q71L, Arf6Q67L, and Arf6Q67L/Q37E/S38I) in PBS buffer (2.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 137 mM NaCl, and 8.1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C by end-over-end rotation. Beads were then washed three times with cell lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 320 mM Sucrose, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% Triton X-100 [w/vol], 1 mM appropriate nucleotide, and 1&#x000d7; protease inhibitors [Boehringer] in PBS). Subsequently, the beads were incubated with 1 ml of cell lysate in lysis buffer (&#x0223c;3 &#x000b5;g total protein) by end-over-end rotation at 4&#x000b0;C for 4 h. Beads were extensively washed and extracted with SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Western blots were developed using
          SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Developed films were scanned using a Perfection 4490 photoscanner (Epson). Data were directly imported into Photoshop software and combined using Illustrator. Data for each pull-down experiment were obtained from one gel with the same exposure time and exactly the same alterations in Photoshop.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Quantitative Western blots</title>
        <p>For quantitative Western blot analysis, we used an FLA-5100 Fluor Imager (Image Reader FLA-5000 series V1.0 software; FujiFilm) to scan blots that were decorated with anti-Arf6 or anti-actin primary antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;labeled secondary antibodies. Scanned blots were then analyzed using MultiGauge software (FujiFilm). Arf6 expression in cells depleted of GAPDH was set as 100%. We analyzed three independent experiments carrying three different data points each (2.5, 5, and 7.5 &#x000b5;g total protein). For graphic display, scanned images were imported into Photoshop, and cropped images were assembled in Illustrator.</p>
        <p>To generate cell lysates, LLC-PK1 cells stably knocking down Arf6 or GAPDH were seeded at a 1:1 dilution onto 10-cm plates. After 24 h, cells were harvested and cracked using a ball-bearing homogenizer in 1 ml Hepes buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.02% [w/vol] NaN<sub>3</sub>, and 1&#x000d7; protease inhibitors [Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH]), followed by a clarifying spin at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C (Eppendorf microcentrifuge). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 2.5, 5, and 7.5 &#x000b5;g of total protein were run on SDS gels, and blotted onto Immobilon FL membranes (Millipore).</p>

        <title>Statistical analysis of immunofluorescence data</title>
        <p>To determine the percentage of basolateral or apical localization of receptors at the surface, TIFF files of confocal xz sections were imported into Volocity 4.4 software (PerkinElmer). We then determined the total amount of pixels at the basolateral (lateral membrane only for HA because of the autofluorescence of the filters) or apical membranes by circling the respective membrane areas as areas of interest. We then calculated the percent values of basolateral or apical receptor based on these data.</p>
        <p>Colocalization was determined by importing confocal raw data into Volocity 4.4 software (PerkinElmer). Note that we only analyzed cells with low-to-moderate expression levels of exogenously expressed markers to avoid saturation. For all images analyzed, we set the threshold levels to the exact same value. We then circled the region of perinuclear TfnR, AP-1B&#x02013;HA, or AP-1A&#x02013;HA staining as the region of interest for the calculation of the Manders overlap coefficients, which were directly converted to percent overlap values (i.e., a Manders coefficient of 0.5 indicates that 50% of the pixels overlap; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manders et al., 1993</xref>). To determine percent localization at the plasma membrane, we calculated the total pixels and interior pixels only of a cell. The amount of signal at the plasma membrane was then calculated using these numbers.</p>
        <p>To determine statistical significance, we first calculated the mean value and SD for each experimental condition. Mean values, SD, and <italic>n</italic> values were then used to calculate P-values in an unpaired student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test using QuickCals (GraphPad Software).</p>
